                <p>Tesla is a great example of using visual hierarchy to guide visitor's attention and enhance user interaction. 
                    The use of a high quality image of a Tesla vehicle captures users attention immediately upon opening the 
                    web page, creating an inviting first impression. The use of appropriate headings and subheadings in varying
                    font sizes and weights helps users quickly identify the main topics while also guiding users on how to navigate the content
                    the webpage easily. The use of color contrast enhances readability while also giving emphasis to 
                    calls to action such as "Order Now" or "Demo Drive". Telsa demonstates visual hierarchy by combining 
                    strategic placement, typography and use of contrasting color to effectively communicate its brand message and 
                    help users easily navigate their website.

                <p>The typography website, Free Faces, is skillful at using the rule of thirds on their website. The design layout
                    is divided into a grid of nine sections, which allows key elements to be positioned for optimal visual impact. 
                    By distributing text and visual elements, including typefaces and design sample information, within the rule 
                    of thirds, Free Faces creates a well-structured page while emphasizing an uncluttered environment giving 
                    each typeface its own space to be highlighted. Different font sizes and styles are displayed uniformally on 
                    the grid, emphasizing important information and making navigation easy to maneuver. Overall, Free Faces 
                    effectively uses the rule of thirds in its typography layout, creating a functional and aestically pleasing design 
                    that engages users and promotes easy navigation througout the site.
